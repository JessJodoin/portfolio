project-description1: |
  The Ottawa International Animation Festival (OIAF) is a yearly festival to showcase cool and interesting animation. They recently celebrated their 40th anniversary, and were wanting to create a design for the festival celebration.
project-description2: |
  To do so, OIAF is looking for a fun posterzine that showcases the festival and all the films being shown. The posterzine will consist of a 22” x 17” full-size poster on one side, and a brochure with festival information and featured films on the other side. This would all fold up into a brochure that when fully opened, will show the poster on the back.
deliverables:
  - "Illustrations and layout design"
  - "22” x 17” posterzine (double-sided)"
goals: |
  My goals were to create an eye-catching poster that would interest people to look at, and have them flip through the posterzine, learn more about the festival, and decide to buy a pass.

process1: |
  First, I started with research to get a feel for OIAF and their brand. I looked at previous posters to see what was typically designed so that I could design something different. Looking through previous posters, I noticed they didn’t stick to one specific style, rather they showcased different designs every year, but they did like weird (which was good for me, I can do weird).
process2: |
  So with that in mind, I started sketching. I wanted to create an interesting design that centred around the theme of time (because it’s their 40th). After sketching a few layout designs and my illustration and getting approval, I started to build my posterzine.
process3: |
  I picked a dark colour theme that fit well with the design, and picked fonts that were readable and simple to not distract from the main illustration. I used grids to make sure all the pieces lined up nicely and looked clean. And then I added all the illustrations, images, and text into the final posterzine layout.

challenges: |
  With the limited space on the poster, fitting all the information given and making sure they had good spacing was a challenge.
final-thoughts: |
  I think this posterzine turned out very successful. It fully encompasses the interesting brand that is OIAF. The final illustration is also very eye-catching with the contrast of the dark background and light clock face, which would make me want to read the posterzine.
