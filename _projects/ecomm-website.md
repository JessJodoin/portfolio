project-description1: |
  For this project, we were to create an eCommerce website for a fictitious company, that we got to make up ourselves. I decided to create a website for a Star Wars themed apparel company that I named Pew Pew (y’know… like a blaster).
project-description2: |
  The website included all Star Wars themed products, from clothing and apparel to stickers and mugs.
deliverables:
  - "Pattern library, and a website with a home page, a shop page, separate products pages, a sale page, a page with legal information, and a checkout page"
  - "Product illustrations, icons, and logo"
goals: |
  My goals were to create a fun Star Wars themed website, that showcases the products well and creates foot-traffic to the eCommerce store. I also wanted to make use of my knowledge of JavaScript to make the website be responsive at all screen sizes.

process1: |
  To start, (like every project) I started with research. I did a competitive analysis of other apparel sites that would be considered competition. This allowed me to get a better understanding of what was popular in apparel sites, and how to make Pew Pew stand out.
process2: |
  I began sketching the webpages necessary for the website. After, I started sketching the logo. I wanted a simple logo that emulated the Star Wars logo to make it more obvious that this store is Star Wars themed. I then moved onto sketching and designing all the products that would be available on the website (there were quite a few, but baby Yoda made it easier!).
process3: |
  With all my assets completed, it was time to move on to the best part; coding! I started with completing a pattern library explaining all elements, what they are used for, how to use them, and their colour schemes and fonts used. I built each piece (buttons and cards and such) first, and then placed them where they needed to go on each webpage until the site was complete.

challenges:
  - "There were a lot of moving parts to coding the Pew Pew website, which made it slightly challenging at first to make sure everything was in working order on each page."
final-thoughts: |
  Though the project, at first, seemed intimidating, I had a lot of fun coding and designing it. I think the project looks good, icons and illustrations are well-done. The design is responsive to all of the screen sizes, and good accessibility standards were used. I think in the future it might be fun to redesign and add more to it (and maybe make it a real site?).
