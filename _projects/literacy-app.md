title: "Literacy App"
description: |
  This UI/UX design project uses the Sustainable Development Goal 4.6, the right to achieve numeracy and literacy for all regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, etc.

project-description1: |
  For this project, we were to design an app that focused on one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the United Nations. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a range of goals proposed to help better the people and the planet.
project-description2: |
  I chose to focus on goal 4.6, numeracy and literacy for all regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, etc. With this in mind, I designed an literacy app that helps with teaching literacy through reading stories, as we tend to remember more easily when it is in story form.
deliverables:
  - "Logo, story illustrations, icons"
  - "High-fidelity app prototype"
goals: |
  The goal of this app was to create a fun and simple to use reading app to encourage children to want to read/learn to read, and be engaged while they are learning.

process1: |
  To begin this project, I started with researching my chosen Sustainable Development Goal, 4.6 literacy and numeracy. With this, I started to mind map my ideas of what app I wanted to design, then I created two target audience personas and researched similar/competing apps.
process2: |
  With all my research and competitive analysis completed, I began sketching the low fidelity prototype. To make sure the flow of the app made sense and was easy to follow, I completed some user testing by having users pretend to click through the paper prototype with minimal instructions. I then took what I learned through the testing to improve the app.
process3: |
  I then illustrated/painted the illustrations for a story to show as an example of how the app would work with a story, and created the high fidelity prototype. I then completed another round of user testing with the high fidelity prototype to see how users interacted with the literacy app. With their useful feedback, I made some final improvements to the literacy app prototype.

challenges: |
  I was not aware of all the program XD was capable of for prototyping. To supplement this, I did quite a bit of my own research to learn more and improve my prototyping skills.
final-thoughts: |
  I very much enjoyed designing this literacy app prototype. I think the final design is easy to use and understand, and makes literacy a fun experience. In the future, I think being able to have a large database of stories and novels available will allow for a wider range of users to improve their reading skills.
