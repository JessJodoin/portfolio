    <p>To start, I knew I wanted to keep the overall design very fun and playful to show the joy that adopting a pet brings. I did some research into the OHS, to get an idea of their overall brand.</p>
    <p>Then I moved on to sketching (the best way to get all your ideas out!). I sketched 3 different layouts, and ultimately decided the third was the best, with some minor changes.</p>
    <p>With the layout design approved, I started to build the newsletter. I designed some fun illustrative pieces, like grass and a fire hydrant, and got some cute pet photos together. I chose a playful typeface for heading, and a good, readable typeface for the body copy. With one last final approval of the design, the newsletter was complete!</p>
