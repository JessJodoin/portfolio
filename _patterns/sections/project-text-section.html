    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Ottawa Humane Society (OHS), is an organization dedicated to rescuing animals. A large part of their job, other than helping stray pets, is to find them loving, forever homes. Though the adoption process can seem scary or long, the OHS wants to show that the process isn’t as bad as they think, and talk about the benefits to adopting a pet rather than buying.</p>
    <p>To do so, the OHS wants to create an adoption-themed newsletter. Using information provided by the OHS, a fun and playful what to know about adoption newsletter will be designed to boost pet adoption.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals for this project were to create a playful pet-themed newsletter that would be informative and fun. I wanted to make the information more digestible with the use of fun colours, cute animal photos, and themed illustrations.</p>
