#####Hi! I’m Jess Jodoin.
I didn’t think I’d end up here, but boy am I happy I did. Art and all things craft-y have always been a huge part of my life. My favourite thing to do when visiting my grandma as a kid was to raid her craft room and turn it into something.

I grew up with my dad saying:
“Do something you like, you don’t have to be crazy about it, just don’t do something that doesn’t make you happy.”

So, I figured it was easy, right? Just a simple point a to point b. Art makes me happy, so that must be the path for me.

Well, I took a little detour (… but the scenic route wasn’t so bad). I went off to UOttawa to study Communications. I really enjoyed it, and learned a lot, but I realized after graduating that I wasn’t sure if this was the career path for me.

So, (and this is where is gets good!) I went out on a limb, whipped up a portfolio, and applied to the graphic design program at Algonquin College. And I haven’t looked back since. I’ve learned lots, met amazing designers, made a bunch of friends, and am so incredibly happy.

Finally, I’m where I’m supposed to be (that’s here!). Creating fun and eye-catching designs that help you grow your business, and look good while doing it. I want to create interesting designs that engage the right people (especially you!). And have fun doing it. I also want you to love the designs as much as I do!
