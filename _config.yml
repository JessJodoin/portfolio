    A portfolio website for my personal brand. This is to showcase my best design work and all the skills I have learned.
  colors:
    sidebar: "--color-primary-light"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Cardo was selected as it was a nice, readable typeface that pairs well with Montserrat. Cardo is to be used for all body copy text throughout the website.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Montserrat was selected becasue it's a bold, clean font. Montserrat is to be used for headings with varying weights and case.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colours were chosen to complement the bright secondary colours. They should be used for the text and in backgrounds.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colours are more vibrant and bright, and should be used for buttons and in some hover situations.

      The red should also be used in alert situation such as error messages on form fields.
    colors.accent: |
      The accent colour is a darker version of a primary colour. It should be used to accent some elements such as form fields.
  layouts:
    default: |
      The default layout should be used for every page, it includes the websiteâ€™s main header and footer.
    case-study: |
      The case study layout should be used for each individual project only.
    error-404-page: |
      The 404 layout is used for the 404 page only. It doesn't have a header or footer, just the space for the 404 error section.
